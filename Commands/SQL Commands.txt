#Creating a view
create view view_1 as
select first_name, last_name 
from user

#Inner join
SELECT * from user inner join supplier on user.user_id = supplier.supplier_id  

The above is the same as,
SELECT * from user, supplier where user.user_id = supplier.supplier_id 

#Union
select user.user_id from user UNION SELECT supplier.supplier_id from supplier 

The above only shows distint values though. To show all, use,
select user.user_id from user UNION ALL SELECT supplier.supplier_id from supplier 

#Alias (rename columns in the output)
select first_name as 'First Name', last_name as 'Last Name' from user

#IN (provide multiple values to the where clause
select user.first_name from user where user.city in (select user.city from user)

or

select user.first_name from user where user.city in ('Rajagiriya', 'Kottawa')

#Left outer join
select * from user left OUTER JOIN supplier on user.user_id= supplier.supplier_id

#Right outer join
select * from user right OUTER JOIN supplier on user.user_id= supplier.supplier_id

#Full outer join
select * from user full outer join supplier on user.user_id= supplier.supplier_id

or using a union of a left outer join and a right outer join

(select * from user left outer join supplier on user.user_id= supplier.supplier_id) UNION (SELECT * from user RIGHT OUTER JOIN supplier on user.user_id= supplier.supplier_id)
